Trevon taught us code topic 1 and did it very well. I just took web engineering last semester so this was just brush up for me. He was prepared to teach and had working examples to show us that he really know what he was teaching. Nothing was left out. Each point was discussed and questions were answered. Everyone felt confident that they know what was taught and they could apply it to their own page for this semester.
