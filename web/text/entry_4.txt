2-7
Today I taught topic 7 and it went very well. Then we had Jacob teach about DOM and creating and adding elements to the HTML page. It was really simple and he did a great job. Only three of us showed up for the meeting though (Lauren was the third) so it went kinda fast. Not a lot of questions needed to be answered so I feel all the lessons were taught very well. These teammates are really great and I am thankful that they continue to show up to the meetings to learn and teach more with all of us.
