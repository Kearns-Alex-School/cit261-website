2-14

No one showed up to the meeting today so I will have to watch what gets posted. I have realized how different it is without the meeting. Each meeting has been good and supportive and with this week and with out that I think I lost some of my own motivation. It made it difficult for me to sit down and do my part of the assignments. Working with others and having others there to talk to helps me out a lot personally.
