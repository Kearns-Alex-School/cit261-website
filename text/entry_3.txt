Today I taught about code topic two and it was a little stressful. There is nothing like being in a group of people you know a little about and having to teach them. It seems like many of them already know a lot, like me, so that I sintimidating. What if my research was not good enough or I mentioned something that was not correct? There really was not anything for me to worry about. The team loved my teaching style and understood everything. I did not get put on the spot because I did not have wrong information. I am really looking for next week. I have to teach again.
