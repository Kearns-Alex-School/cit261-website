Today I taught about code topic two and it was a little stressful. There is nothing like being in a group of people you know a little about and having to teach them. It seems like many of them already know a lot, like me, so that I sintimidating. What if my research was not good enough or I mentioned something that was not correct? There really was not anything for me to worry about. The team loved my teaching style and understood everything. I did not get put on the spot because I did not have wrong information. I am really looking for next week. I have to teach again.

Jacob taught about AJAX. He did a great job for a topic that takes a while to get your head around it. Since it is asycnhonous it can be difficult to know how to get it all to work. Bassically it makes a method that waits for a respone from a server and then finishes the code. This is really powerful when dealing with databases and other APIs. For inforation that he did not know much about he have us a link to a few sites that we can check out for more information.
