Met with the group for the first time. All of them seem really nice and professional with knowledge on the topics we are covering. This is going to make learning a little bit easier since we each can contribute our own skills to the teaching process. We made a teaching plan that starts with everything being taught at least once and then we are deciding to later if there are topics that we need to spend more time on. There is not a great structure for this class but I think we have figured out the bulk of how things are going to be run.
